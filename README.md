# Nuts Node Pentest Setup

This setup has been published on https://github.com/nuts-foundation/pentest-setup

The following has been set up:

- Nuts Node with all its HTTP APIs exposed on port `1323`,
- with a DID document configured as node DID (connection authentication): `did:nuts:8fbYxyYNNDjyTMyEQuusptr7LjirQYHxKFtw7qi2Szb1`
- with a NutsOrganizationCredential issued to it (required for access token flow)

When the Nuts Node interacts with a "remote node" (requesting access token) it actually uses the local node,
which is OK since remote nodes will run the same software (albeit maybe a different version).

The node has been configured to use "strict mode" which disallows unsafe default configurations.

The node can be started with `docker compose up`

## TLS

TLS has been disabled on HTTP endpoints. In a production situation, the following paths (and their subpaths) should be secured by TLS:

- `/public` with a publicly trusted server certificate.
- `/n2n` with a PKIoverheid Private server certificate, also requiring a client certificate (same chain).
- gRPC with a PKIoverheid Private server certificate, also requiring a client certificate (same chain).
- Other endpoints aren't secured with TLS, since they're meant for internal use (administrative apps, monitoring). Although they should be blocked, it would be interesting to see what damage can be done when not.

## Private keys

Persisted on disk found in `./data/crypto` (host mount) and `/opt/data/crypto` (in container).

## Endpoints of Interest

The following endpoints are considered of interest due to their attack surface.
They are in order of criticalness (topmost is deemed most critical).

Refer to https://nuts-node.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pages/integrating/api.html?urls.primaryName=Auth for further reference.

### Creating an Access Token
HTTP endpoint called by other Nuts nodes to create a JWT token, which is used to gain access to medical data at other parties.
It uses the OAuth grant token flow: the local node signs a grant token, which is exchanged at the target Nuts node for a JWT (bearer) access token.
The latter is then used for gaining access to medical data.

The API of interest is:
```http request
POST /n2n/auth/v1/accesstoken
```

A successful call can be made by calling the **Shortcut flow** (see `http-requests/create-access-token.http`)
This call creates a JWT-grant token (valid for 5 seconds) and immediately sends it to the API mentioned above.

### gRPC Network Protocol
Nuts nodes communicate using a gRPC network protocol, available on port `5555`. 
Any server with a valid PKIoverheid Private server certificate can contact the node through this port. 

### Public IRMA endpoints
IRMA authentication uses a mobile app which communicates with publicly available endpoints, exposed by the Nuts Node.

Creating an IRMA signing session:

```http request
POST /public/auth/irmaclient/session
```

Querying the status of a session:

```http request
GET /public/auth/irmaclient/session/<token>
```

### Signing a JWT

```http request
POST /internal/crypto/v1/sign_jwt
```

### Nuts Node status
Endpoint for returning node status (OK/not OK).

```http request
GET /status
```

### Diagnosing Nuts Node
Endpoint for returning detailed node status in JSON or YAML format (depends on `Accept` header).

```http request
GET /status/diagnostics
```

### Monitoring Nuts Node
Endpoint for returning Prometheus metrics of the node.

```http request
GET /metrics
```
